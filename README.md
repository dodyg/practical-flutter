Micro samples for Flutter mobile development platform

I have no idea yet on Flutter development but I am going to figure it out this year. I really dont' like native mobile development due to its real slow compile/refresh cycle. I used to be an early adopter of Kotlin (circa .4). The Kotlin team actually used my open source project as a test bed for Kotlin Android support.
