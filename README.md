Micro samples for Flutter mobile development platform

I have no idea yet on Flutter development but I am going to figure it out this year. I really dont' like native mobile development due to its real slow compile/refresh cycle. I used to be an early adopter of Kotlin (circa .4). The Kotlin team actually used my open source project as a test bed for Kotlin Android support.

Samples:

* [alert_dialog_page.dart](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-flutter/tree/master/projects/ui/lib/pages/alert_dialog_page.dart)
  
  Shows how to create and display dialog page

* [hello_world_page.dart](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-flutter/tree/master/projects/ui/lib/pages/hello_world_page.dart)

  Hello world page

* [row_page.dart](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-flutter/tree/master/projects/ui/lib/pages/row_page.dart)

  Shows the simplest usage of Row layout
